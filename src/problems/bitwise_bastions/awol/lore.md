# Deserter

*What are the Bitfolk running from...*

*Problem: AWOL*

So these Bitfolk are these emotionless, militant beings... yet they're clearly scared of something. Desertion is no small deal in any militant society. Either way, there is a weird way of life going on here. But despite that, it seems people are growing - dare you say - soft? I guess only making two choices at any decision makes it a 50/50 if a Bitfolk abandons post... you think?

# Edges

*The infamous Edgex huh...*

*Encounter: Blockage*

It makes sense now. If we are to look at this region as a graph, than the relationships between things can be represented by Edges... And these beavers aren't the only things attacking these edges. The Edges themselves are decomposing at the core... and that core must be central to Nodak. Upon venturing there, you find a large pedestal for a weirdly shaped artifact, missing. Time to go find this one too.

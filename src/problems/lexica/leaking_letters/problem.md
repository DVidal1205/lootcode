# Leaking Letters

I wish we knew why... but all of our records or scriptures are becoming stretched. It has become increasingly hard to read.

Just the other day, our copy of Wigglethorn's Journal made sense, but now its all jumbled. For instance, the word "trumbone" has now become "ttrruuummmbbbooooonneeeee." These weird things keep happening ever since...

## Input

Input will consist of a single word

```
ttrruuummmbbbooooonneeeee
```

## Processing

Remove all ADJACENT duplicate letters, having each letter only appear once in a given position without being adjacent to itself. Don't worry about the validity of words that contain two adjacent letters, like "book," or "tell," the locals should know what you mean.

## Output

Print the corrected word on a single line

```
trumbone
```

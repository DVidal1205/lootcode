# Disturbances

*Observed while helping restoring the Leaking Letters of Lexica*

This place is definitely new to you, but you can recognize turmoil when you see it. It's clear that words in this region are not just culturally significant, but magically significant. It is admittedly alarming that these runes and glyphs are spontaneously unraveling themselves. Clearly something has changed, there is no way they've lasted this long with such unstable ways. Perhaps you'll get to the bottom of it soon.

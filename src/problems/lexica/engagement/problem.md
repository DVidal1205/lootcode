# Engagement

We really love reading, I mean, it's all we do. The issue is, we've become so eager for thought provoking, deeply enriching literature, that our attention spans have severely dulled. Thankfully though, all of our text entries would have a predetermined "engagement level," which would really just be some statistics about the length of the words in the entry.

This used to be inscribed automatically on the back of every book, but the darn thing has been acting up lately.

# Input

Input will consist of a text entry, with _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)_ number of words separated by spaces.

- median length

- smallest length

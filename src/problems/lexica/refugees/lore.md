*A realization of yours, after helping broken families find shelter*

*Problem: Refugees*

Things are seriously getting out of hand here. Its been a few weeks of volunteer work around Lexica, and apparently the root cause of this all is something going missing... They call it the *Alphabind?* Whatever it is, it's important... And its not just here either. Lexica, just like the rest of this world, has been robbed of something important. And you are going to get it back... once you figure out whatever the hell an *Alphabind* is. In the meanwhile, keep these people safe.

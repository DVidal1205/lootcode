# Refugees

It's an old convention, don't get me wrong, but some of us must have thought it would be fun to name each generation of our families as anagrams of each others names. Ask my two kids, Dylan and Nylda, they think its pretty funny.

Just a few days ago, there was a pretty nasty landslide near Fortwalsh's Landing, and we've got a lot of people misplaced. Thankfully, though, they all follow that old time naming convention, and we can use that to get them set up with temporary housing with their families.

# Input

The first line of input will be an integer, _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)_, which represents the number of people that need to be sorted into families. Then, the following _n_ lines will be a single name (all lowercase, no spaces or hypens) to be grouped into a family.

```
5
leonard
nylda
neloard
dylan
luke
```

# Output

Print the number of facilities needed to store the families. Then, print each family on its own line. The family groupings must appear in order of appearance based on the first name in the family. Print each name within the family sorted alphabetically, separated by spaces.

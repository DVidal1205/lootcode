# Sticks

We're beginning to set up our annual elementary architecture competition, where we task our brightest young minds to creating architectural wonders. Of course, we don't want them doing this at scale, so we give them sticks. We want a fair competition, so we need your help getting the sticks all sorted for us in time.

There are *n* sticks with some lengths. Your task is to modify the sticks so each stick has the same length. You can either lengthen and shorted each stick, with each operation costing *x* - the difference between the new and original length.

We need your help to find the minimum total cost of sorting our sticks for the AEA.

## Input

The first input line contains an integer __n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5)__: the number of sticks.

Then there are n integers: __p1 , p2 , ... , p_n; p_i (1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^9)__: the lengths of the sticks.

# Sticks

There are n sticks with some lengths. Your task is to modify the sticks so that each stick has the same length.

You can either lengthen and shorten each stick. Both operations cost x where x is the difference between the new and original length.

What is the minimum total cost?

## Input

The first input line contains an integer __n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5)__: the number of sticks.

Then there are n integers: __p1 , p2 , ... , p_n; p_i (1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^9)__: the lengths of the sticks.

# Wordup

You love finding random properties in words and recently, you've been fascinated with "Up
Words", words that already have their letters in sorted order, with no repeated letters. In order to
aid your search for these words, write a program that can automatically discern if a word is an
"Up Word" or not.

Given a string with all lower case letters, determine whether or not the letters are distinct and in
alphabetical order.

## Input

Input will have a non-empty string of lowercase letters of length 26 or less.

```
act
```

## Output

Output "YES" or "NO" on a single line, depending on
whether or not the corresponding string is an "Up Word" as previously defined.

```
YES
```

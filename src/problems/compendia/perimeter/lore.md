*Who knew you could coordinate a search team...*

*Problem: Perimeter*

Well, there you have it. You don't need them to tell you what you're looking for - enough snooping has led you to the *Tome of Equilibrium*. Held in the archival center of the university, this thing would magically sort and assemble various components of the university into groups or categories by parameter - *instantaneously*. As long as you were in the domain of the university, that is. After days of picking sticks and finding "Up Words," you want to find this damn Tome and quit doing all this manual labor... Plus things could get pretty chaotic without it pretty soon.

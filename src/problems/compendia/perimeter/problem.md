# Perimeter

Something crucial to the university has gone missing - but the dean isn't really letting us specify what. We need help organizing a search party to secure the perimeter of various search sites. Your task is to assemble the largest possible perimeter using teams measured by their effective range, symbolized as ribbons of varying lengths. You must sort these teams by their range and strategically select a trio whose combined perimeter is as large as possible. If it's impossible to form such a perimeter from the available teams, your result should be 0.

Now, without knowing what you're looking for, I wonder how useful this will even be. But hey, the dean is always right!

## Input

The first line of input will consist of an Integer __n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4)__ representing the amount of triangle sides you have. The next line contains n space separated integers representing the length of each triangle side.

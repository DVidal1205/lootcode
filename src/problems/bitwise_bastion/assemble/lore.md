*You're telling me, the Dichomoton is the creator?*

*Problem: Assemble*

In a shocking turn, not only is the *Dichomoton* actually the supreme general of this whole military gig, but he creates the Bitfolk as well? That makes its disappearance surprisingly alarming... Maybe the phrase "grew legs and walked away" actually could work here - I mean the Dichomoton is a sentient magical machine. But where would it go?

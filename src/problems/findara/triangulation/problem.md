# Triangulation

We've been given a task, we need to build a bridge. And everyone knows that the best shape to build bridges with are triangles, I mean, have you ever played Polygon Overpass? It's a classic!

However, it isn't easy coming up with all of the possible triangles we can make with our supplies. That's where you come in! We need you to help us figure out how many triangles we can make with the supplies we have, which are varying lengths.

For example, in the case of 2, 2, 3, and 4, we have 3 valid triangles. 2 3 4, 2 3 4 (with the second 2), and 2 2 3. I hope you can get this done quickly, we need to get this bridge built!

## Input

The input will consist of _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000)_, representing the number of lengths to read. Then, the next line will consist of _n_ non-distinct, unsorted, space separated integers, where each integer is a length of a side of a triangle.

```
4
2 2 3 4
```

## Output

The output will consist of a single integer, the number of valid triangles that can be made with the given lengths.

```
3
```

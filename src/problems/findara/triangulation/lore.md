_Found amongst the masses of planks_

_Problem: Triangulation_

While it wasn't asked of you, eventually there weren't enough planks left to assemble these bridges. You decided to travel up and over a few hills to search for more tinder to chop more, but instead, found something a bit alarming. Off in the distance, through the large _Search Boundary_, a young Findar sat against a rock, ill. You, being a human, quickly rescue him from outside the border. As it turns out, these Findar people cannot survive outside of their _Search Boundary_ and quickly become overwhelmed and displaced. This makes things more pressing - you need to figure out why this shrinkage is occurring, and how to stop it!

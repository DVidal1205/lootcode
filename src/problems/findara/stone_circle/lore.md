*After traversing one too many stone circles...*

*Problem: Stone Circles*

Findara is an interesting place, that's for sure. The people here are very observant, but one thing that sticks out is their ability to find things. These Stone Circle sites are scattered all throughout. There is something off, though. That big border that surrounds this place - you think they call it the *Search Boundary*, was moving toward inwards as you followed FIndars through the woods. It shouldn't be doing that, right?

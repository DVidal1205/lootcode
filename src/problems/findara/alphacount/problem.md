# Alphacount

The letters, th... the.. they ran away from us. Despair has befallan Findara as we can no longer write our scriptures without our letters. 
Pesky letters, if only we had the thing we could've found them lickety-split, but this is proving to be much more of a challange than we orginally thought.

If only there was someone who could report some information about the whereabouts of the letters.

## Input
Input will consist of a single string of size  _s (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000)_.

```
Hello World
```

## Output
Output a string of 26 characters. The objective is to set each of the 26 characters to either **1** or **0** based on the fact whether the Nth letter of the alphabet is present in the input string.
For example if the letter **A** is in the input then the 1st character should be a **1** since **A** is the first letter in the alphabet. 

__Uppercase and Lowercase both count__

# Lens

*You've figured it out... Where the power of the Search Boundary comes from...*

*Problem: Twinned*

After finding pairs of Twin Relics, and long discussions with the Findara Adventurers Guild, it is clear the source of this *Search Boundary* is magical relics. But there is one the Guild references that seems to be the strongest - the Lens of Clarity. It is said to be powered by the exploration and expansion of Findars, allowing everyone in the region to view previously discovered places? But apparently, no amount of effort has pushed the boundary back as of late... It must be missing just like everything else in this damn planet. Time to go find that too...

# Twinned

We are searching for the powerful Twin Relics, a pair of ancient artifacts that will allow us to expand our Search Boundary, which is crucial ever since it started... shrinking.

We have assembled a horde of relics from various scavenges, and now we need to find the Twin Relics among them. The Twin Relics are two relics that are identical in every way, except for their power levels. The power level of the Twin Relics come in _x_ and _2x_, where one of the relics has exactly double the power level of the other.

We need you to help us find the Twin Relics among the horde of relics we have. Can you do it?

## Input

The input will consist of _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000)_, representing the number of relics in the horde. Then, the next line will consist of _n_ non-distinct, space separated integers, where each integer is a power level of a relic.

# Unfathomable

*You're glad you found a way to cheat this game of theirs... otherwise you'd be cooked*

*Problem: Trailing Zeroes*

Amen for math. I mean seriously, who the hell is calculating 100000 factorial. However, it is clear that your assertion about calculators was half true. Long ago, it was said a trinket known as the *Symmetract* would do all of these complications for the people of Arithmend.. but - you guessed it - ITS MISSING. Why do things just go missing in this planet? I guess you'll have to go find that now too...

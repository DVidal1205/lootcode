# Trailing Zeroes

It is standard around here to compute mathematical expressions for fun. Finding the factorial of any concievably large number is usually quite fun, but its gotten boring. We need to spice things up a bit. So, we have decided to find the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number.

This problem is still quite simple, but we've introduced another constraint - time. We need to find the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number, but we need to do so quickly. And I mean, really quickly. This challenge seems like a lot more fun now, doesn't it? Have fun!

## Input

The input will contain a single integer, _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000)_, which represents the number to find the number of trailing zeroes in its factorial.

```
5
```

## Output

Print a single integer, _z_, which represents the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of _n_.

```
1
```

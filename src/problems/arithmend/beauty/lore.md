There seems to be more than meets the eye here... Yeah, numbers are important, but these people seem to ingrain it so deeply in their culture. But if that were truly the case, then why do they need help from a guy like me to do all of these complex calculations? I mean, I'm not complaining, but it just seems a bit odd. I guess I'll just have to keep going and see what happens.

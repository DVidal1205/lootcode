# Bigger Digits

It's that time of the year again. Every year we have a tradition to become a better version of ourselves, so we want to order ourselves in such a way to become that better version. As it stands each of us has a height and since we always stand in a line we can represent ourselves as a number. So to actualize this better version we want to become the next biggest number we can.

## Input

Input is a single number, _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^17)_, with each digit representing the height of a person. 
```
2017
```

## Output 
Print the next largest number you can make with the same heights. If it's impossible then print -1.

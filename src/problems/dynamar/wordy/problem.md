# Wordy

We've got a pretty simple problem, but really, we're just tired. Navigating the labyrinth has become more and more taxing, and we need some help with the simpler things man. We seek to find overlaps between things as a way to find complexity. It's a pretty silly task, but we need help finding subsequent overlaps. Given a sequence of letters as well as subsequence from the original word, you are to count how many times the particular subsequence occurs.

## Input

Input will consist of two non-empty strings of lowercase letters on seperate lines. The first of these strings is the
given input sequence while the second string will be the subsequence for which to search. 

It is guaranteed that the length of the first string is 1000 or less and that the length of the subsequence
is less than or equal to the length of the given sequence. Furthermore, itâ€™s guaranteed that the
subsequence appears at least once in the sequence.

## Output

For each test case, output a single line with the number of occurrences of the given subsequence.
The cases will be such that this value is less than 10^18.

*Problem: Weaving*

So, yeah, these huge hunky buff people love weaving... I mean really? I guess it would make sense, given their levels of complex thinking. But this whole weaving thing is almost cultural... Rumors of something called the *Cache* come up, said to represent life within the maze itself, and contains the outcome of all possible decisions represented by deviating strings of yarn. This weaving you observed seems by no means peaceful, though. It is almost as if the people are trying to weave a new *Cache,* like the old one is defective...

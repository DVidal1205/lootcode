*These people are seriously strong. You're surprised they didn't swing at you when you showed up at the entrance*

*Problem: Jacked*

Other than the fact that they lift like, insane amounts of weight, these Dymads are unique creatures to say the least. First, they're blind, almost by default? There is hardly any sun in this terribly large maze, and their biology almost reminds you of large sea creatures. Is this gigantism at work? Who knows. Either way, you didn't really expect such large creatures to be so incredibly decisive and smart... You've got a lot to learn from these guys.

# Merger

We have a series of batallions. However, due to speculations from the higher ups about some trouble looming on the horizon, we need to conduct some merging of batallions into larger groups.

Given a list of batallions, we need to merge them into larger groups, where the merging of groups is achieved by simply adding them together. However, these soldiers are very close minded, and we must do so in a way they will understand.

Merge each batallion, strictly without using the addition operator. If you do... well... I'm not sure what those soldiers will do to you. I wouldn't want to find out.

## Input

The first line of input will be an integer, _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000)_, representing the number of batallions. The next _n_ lines will consist of 2 space separated integers, each representing a batallion.

```
4
1 2
3 4
5 6
7 8
```

## Output

Print the size of the merged batallions, one per line.

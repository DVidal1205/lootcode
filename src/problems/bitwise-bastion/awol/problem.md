# AWOL

We have plans to assemble a fleet of bitwise soldiers to man watchtowers along the border. The issue is that a single soldier has gone AWOL, or Absent Without Leave. We need to find out who it is.

We have a list of soldiers, each represented by a unique ID number from 1 to _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000)_. Find the ID number of the soldier who is missing.

## Input

The first line of input will be an integer, _n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100000)_, representing the number of soldiers in the list. The next line will consist of _n_ space separated integers, each representing a soldier's ID number.

```
4
0 2 3 4
```

## Output

Print the ID number of the missing soldier.

```
1
```

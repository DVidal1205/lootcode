# Withering

*Discovery of the Rotten Root...*

*Problem: Negation*

As are the people of this region, it seems that the forest of the Arbonclave itself has begun to wither and decay... The source of this decay is coming from the central Arbors, and upon following it, you notice something terrible. The grand Ursol Tree, rumored to be the birthplace of the first Treefolk, has begun decaying too. It is clear now that the vitality lost in the Treefolk mirrors that of the Ursol Tree... The life of this monumental tree is missing, and perhaps there is a cure in Algorion that could restore life to the Arbonclave.

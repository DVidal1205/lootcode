# Family Feud I

For as long as there has been treefolk in the Arbonclave, the Palmford and Sod-dunk families have been fighting each-other.
With recent disruptions in the life-cycle causing these families to expand exponentially, their conflict threatens to break apart the entire forest.

We don't want to prune the entire family, but we ARE willing to risk some collateral damage. Both families frequent Lou's Tavern, where much of the conflict festers. Maybe if we get rid of the tavern, they'll have less places to bicker...

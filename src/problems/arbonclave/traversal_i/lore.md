*Hints of the familial structure in the Arbonclave*

*Problem: Traversal I*

Helping the Treefolk get around was a pretty simple task, and honestly quite fun. There does seem to be a bit of a threat to the Arbonclave though... Rumor has it that births have become sporadic lately, but even worse, some Treefolk have been unable to grow children all together. Most of the issues here seem to be cultural issues, so you can keep eavesdropping while you help.

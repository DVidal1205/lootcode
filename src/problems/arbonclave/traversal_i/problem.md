# Traversal I

Hello fair traveller... We here at the Arbonclave are experts at organization, and thus, we have come up with a form of organizing our treehouses. From each house, you can move to two other houses. The house to the left has a smaller address, and the house to the right has a larger address. This format helps us organize ourselves in a way that is easy to navigate.

For various reasons, we need to represent the layout of our houses in different orders. We have a few different ways to do this, and we need your help to implement them.

The three different representations are in-order, pre-order, and post-order.

- In-order: In this representation, we first visit the left child, then the current node, and finally the right child.
- Pre-order: In this representation, we first visit the current node, then the left child, and finally the right child.
- Post-order: In this representation, we first visit the left child, then the right child, and finally the current node.

For each of these representations, we need you to implement a way to tell us the order of the houses for each of the three representations.

## Input

Input will consist of a single integer, _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000)_, which represents the number of houses in the Arbonclave. The next line will contain _n_ distinct, space-separated integers, which represent the addresses of the houses in the Arbonclave.

```
5
3 1 4 2 5
```

## Output

Output will consist of three lines, each containing the order of the houses in the Arbonclave for the in-order, pre-order, and post-order representations, respectively, after assembling the values as a binary search tree.

```
1 2 3 4 5
3 1 2 4 5
2 1 5 4 3
```

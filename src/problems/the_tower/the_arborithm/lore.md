# Plague

_Problem: The Arborithm_

"YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF JUMPING INTO THE ARBORITHM PLAGUE... PERHAPS YOU'RE SMARTER THAN I THOUGHT. NO MATTER, YOU ARE STILL A FOOL TO THINK THIS IS THE LAST YOU'LL SEE OF ME!"

It's definitely scary holding such a powerfully dangerous artifact in the palm of your hand. It's cold, despite the fact that it is constantly beating like a human heart. You would think that would make it warm. Regardless, there are full religions around this thing, better to keep it safe than to let it fall into the wrong hands.

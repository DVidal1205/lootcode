# The Symmetract

"YOU COULDN'T OPEN A JAR OF PICKLES WITH THOSE CLUMSY HANDS OF YOURS... GOOD LUCK REACTIVATING THE SYMMETRACT!"

The Symmetract, a magical tabloid device, is the source of logic and reason within Arithmend. Said to be responsible for the creation of the beautifully structured architecture of the region, this device is crucial to the Numerans of Arithmend. Now, locked in the tower, the Symmetract has been sent into a stasis of sorts, and must be reactivated. Across the rectangular face of the Symmetract, a user is able to input different runes, commands, or spells. The reactivation sequence is quite simple, but requires extreme precision and accuracy.

During the reactivation sequence, the Symmetract will display two circular regions. In order to reactivate the Symmetract, the user must touch a point within or on the boundary of each circle simultaneously, with the two points needing to be as close as possible. The Symmetract will then be reactivated, and the user will be able to access the information stored within.

The laws of arithmetic itself have begun to unravel in Arithmend. Take back the Symmetract, and get the Numerans back on track!

## Input

Input. will consist of two lines. Both lines will consist of three integers, _x_, _y_ and _r_ _(-10^4 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^4 ; 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^4)_, corresponding to the x and y-coordinates of an circles center and its radius, respectively. It is guaranteed that the two circles will not intersect and that neither circle will contain the other.

-3 -4 1
```

## Output

Output should consist of four real numbers: x1, y1, x2 and y2, the x- and y-coordinates of where
the you should touch the circles. The points should be as close as possible, and have 6 decimal places of precision.

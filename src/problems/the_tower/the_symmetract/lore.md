_Problem: The Symmetract_

"THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYMMETRACT STANDS IN CONTRAST TO THE COMPLEXITY OF YOUR MIND!"

The Symmetract appears the most abstract of the artifacts you're seeking to collect... with weird geometric shapes and patterns shifting with time. Some of them are even floating around the core of the artifact. Some Numerans did tell you that buildings used to float in Arithmend... Maybe you can use it to ascend the tow- no, that would be too easy. No cheating, you're going to do this the hard way, and prove your worth.

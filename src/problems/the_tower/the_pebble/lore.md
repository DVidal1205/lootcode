_Problem: The Pebble_

"okay that one i'm not even mad about just look at that thing"

Okay screw them. This thing is the base of all of the Stackspires. You've seen too many landslides and collapses to overlook it. They are right about it being underwhelming though... it really is just a pebble. But in your heart you know that its strength comes from its importance. Putting it back under the Stackspires will be a lot of work though...

_Problem: The Alphabind_

"THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL YOU WERE ABLE TO SOLVE THAT PUZZLE! YOU MUST HAVE HAD HELP FROM CRYPTOGRAPHERS IN LEXICA... NO MATTER... YOU WONT BE LEAVING HERE IN ONCE PIECE!"

Following the divine word of the Alphabind, you begin to navigate the traps laid around you with ease. Is this the power that was stolen from Lexica all of this time? Regardless, you continue to navigate the tower in search of reaching the top. At first this was a task of retrieval, but now you feel eager to show whoever is atop this tower what you're made of.

**"Great, great, so I think we can go ahead and move on to our next problem..."**

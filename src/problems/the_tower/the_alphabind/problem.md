Write a Morse code decoder for wired electrical telegraph. 

An electric telegraph is operated on a 2-wire line with a key that, when pressed, connects the wires together, which can be detected on a remote station. The Morse code encodes every character being transmitted as a sequence of "dots" (short presses on the key) and "dashes" (long presses on the key).

When transmitting the Morse code, the international standard specifies that:

- "Dot" – is 1 time unit long.
- "Dash" – is 3 time units long.
- Pause between dots and dashes in a character – is 1 time unit long.
- Pause between characters inside a word – is 3 time units long.
- Pause between words – is 7 time units long.

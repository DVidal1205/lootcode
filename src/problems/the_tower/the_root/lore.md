*Problem: The Root*

"YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST WALK IN HERE AND TAKE THE ROOT? YOU'RE NOT EVEN WORTHY OF TOUCHING IT!"

The Root looks to be just that - a root. However, you can tell the signifcant power that it holds. While it isn't in the same way that humans experience it, this hunk of wood is the first Treefolk, and the ancestor to all. Not to mention, its absence has caused a lot of problems for the Arbonclave. Keep on moving forward, and get it back where it belongs.

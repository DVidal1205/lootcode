# Technica Ingoramus

As you have gathered the lost items of Algorion, you ascend to the final floor of the Tower. On the rooftop of this corporate monolith, you are met with a humanoid creature, unlike the one you saw on the balcony upon arrival. It wears the same clothes, although tattered and torn, signifying that this _thing_ is what remains of the human who greeted you.

Disgustingly transformed, this beast now takes on a form best represented as a demon of ego and arrogance. Seemingly determined to make you feel less than you are, it speaks to you with a voice that echoes through the Tower.

"YOU HAVE COME FAR, BUT YOU WILL NOT SUCCEED. I AM THE FINAL TEST, THE FINAL CHALLENGE. YOU WILL NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE ALIVE."

You are taken aback by the creature's words, but you know that you must defeat it to complete your journey. You must defeat the Technica Ingoramus. But what seeps into your psyche is a feeling of confidence that you have not felt before. You know that you can defeat this creature, and you know that you will. You were born to inherit the grand world of Algorion, and all that stands in your way is this creature.

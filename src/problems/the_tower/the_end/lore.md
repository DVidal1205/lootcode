_Encounter: The End_

Slaying Technica Ingoramus, the creature falls down the side of the Tower until it makes impact with the ground below. You feel a slight rumble from beneath your feet, as if the sanctity of the Tower was tied to the beast. Leaving is probably your best bet. You could run, but your gut tells you that your valor will be rewarded. Retrieving the magical artifacts you have collected, they begin to harmonize with each other with a dull hum, teleporting you back to the mainland. You turn to the shore and watch as the tower crumbles. You emerge triumphant, and dedicated to the cause of Algorion. You are a legend, and you are a hero.

As you bring the glory back to the regions of Algorion, you are met with gratitude. After weeks of traveling the face of the planet on tours of celebration, you finally feel it is time to rest. Settling atop an empty hill, you look out at the world you have saved. Going to sleep, you awake in a room far different than the one you fell asleep in. The time is 9:32AM, and on your nightstand is your phone. It just strikes you that you have somehow lived all this time without one. Opening it, a single email notification catches your eye. It reads:

_"We are pleased to extend you an offer! Welcome to the team!"_

*Problem: The Dichomoton*

"THERE'S NO WAY... THE DICHOMOTON HAS FALLEN? THIS WON'T BE THE LAST OBSTACLE YOU'LL FACE... YOU'RE BOUND TO SLIP UP EVENTUALLY!"

The core of the Dichomoton is a lot lighter than you'd expect it to be, given the fact that it powered a 15 foot tall mechanism. It's got a nice sublte hum to it. Once you bring it back to the Bastions, maybe you could help with making the new chasis. With each artifact you reclaim, you don't just feel relieved for the people of the Bastions, but you feel confident in your intellectual abilities. This feeling is nice.

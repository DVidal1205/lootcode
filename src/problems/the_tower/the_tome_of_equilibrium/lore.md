# Equilibrium

*Problem: The Tome of Equilibrium*

"MAYBE YOU COULD USE THE TOME TO SORT THE THOUGHTS IN YOUR HEAD, IF ONLY IT WASN'T EMPTY!"

Now that you've got the Tome, you really wonder how important the University system is to Compendia. Since the absence of this has crippled the region as a whole, you get the idea that Compendia takes school seriously! Maybe they could've sent some of their students to this damn tower instead of sending you... Things are never that easy. Despite their oversight, you'll just have to lob this back too.

_Problem: The Index Orb_

"THE ORB MAY NOT HAVE IMPLODED, BUT WATCHING YOU CLIMB THIS TOWER MAKES MY BRAIN IMPLODE INSTEAD. HOW COULD YOU BE SO NAIVE!"

The Index Orb actually appears much more like a gem than an orb, but that's besides the point. It doesn't seem to serve you much purpose here, but glancing into it reveals the magical powers of Vectara. You watch as flickers of magic dart within the edge of the gem. You're not sure what it means, but you're sure it's important, and that Vectara needs it back.

**"Welcome! We're excited to have you here. Let's get started."**

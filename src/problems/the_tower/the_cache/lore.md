_Problem: The Cache_

"THE CACHE HUH? YOU THINK YOU'RE SO CLEVER, DON'T YOU? WELL, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE JUST A FOOL WHO THINKS THEY CAN OUTSMART ME. I'LL SHOW YOU, I'LL SHOW YOU ALL!"

The Dymads weren't kidding when they said that you just _know_ what the Cache is trying to tell you. Getting out of that maze wasn't easy on an empty stomach, but this thing has gotta come in handy for navigating this weird tower. Despite all the taunting, you can't help but feel a little bit of excitement. You're getting closer to the top, and you're getting closer to the truth. You won't let this belittling get to you. You're better than that.

**"Of course! If you have any questions about the process, be sure to email your recruiter!"**

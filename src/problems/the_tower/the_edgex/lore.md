_Problem: The Edgex_

"YOU CAN NAVIGATE YOUR WAY AROUND THE EDGEX, BUT I BET YOU CAN'T NAVIGATE YOUR WAY AROUND AN OFFICE. HA!"

The face of the Edgex glows with a faint light as you pick it up. You notice that it begins to give you an interface that appears something like a map of the tower! You can't help but feel a little bit of excitement. You're getting closer to the top, and you're getting closer to the truth. Use the Edgex to your advantage, and then return it to Nodak.

**"So, how do you appraoch learning new technologies?"**

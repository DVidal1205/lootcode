_Problem: The Lens of Clarity_

"YOU MAY HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR, BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE THE TRUTH. YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE THE TRUTH, THAT I AM BETTER THAN YOU!"

With the recalibration of the Lens of Clarity, staring into it reveals the full breadth of Findara. Everything else you're here for is powerful, but this, this is truly beautiful. As you peer into the lens, you see a statue of you has been erected in Findara in honor of your help. You can't wait to see their face when you come back with this.

**"Clever thinking! Signs of an ideal candidate..."**

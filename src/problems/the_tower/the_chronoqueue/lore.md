*Problem: The Chronoqueue*

"YOU CAN BUY ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD, BUT YOU'LL NEVER REACH THE PINNACLE I STAND UPON. NOT NOW, NOT EVER!"

The Chronoqueue is quite neat. It seems the size of it depends on the grains of sand within it... which makes transporting it easy now that you've emptied it out. Maybe you could use this to your advantage in the future. Or maybe you shouldn't get too greedy, this thing is responsible for the birth of an entire race after all. You're not sure what the future holds, but you're sure that you're going to be ready for it.

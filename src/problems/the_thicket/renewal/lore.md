# Ceremony

*Yeah... the Arborithm is cooked*

*Problem: Renewal*

After helping orchestrate such a grand Renewal Ceremony, it is clear how much goes into keeping the Thicket alive and responsive. But according to priests, it was never this hard to keep it alive. Something has disturbed the natural forces of the *Arborithm*. Just like everywhere else in this planet... this region is plagued too. You can never catch a break, can you?

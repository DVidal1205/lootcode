*This way of life is... unique*

*Problem: Correction*

Communicating through markings on trees is definitely new to you, but you could see why such a weird form of communication is chosen. This forest, it really is alive, and changes unpredictably. Being out in the winding paths of the Thicket is dangerous, you never know how quickly you'll get lost. I guess there is no point waiting to talk to someone, better to leave a message and hope they find someone. Or maybe... the forest will bring the message to them?

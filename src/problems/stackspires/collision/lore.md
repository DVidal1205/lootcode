# Base

*An investigation made after growing tired of the chaos*

*Problem: Collision*

Having to protect civilians from collapsing rubble is a terrible past time. It saddens you to see this happen to these whimsical people. You decide to investigate the cause of the instability and frequent tremors. Standing far away from the base of the Spire Plateau, you spot it - the base of the region. Upon further inspection, there is a deep indent into the ground that is of a different size... Its almost as if the first rock, the bottom of the stack, was forcibly removed from the region. This would have many consequences given the magical forces the locals mention... Perhaps this is chaotic curse placed upon them... But the base could not have grown legs and walked away. Once again, you feel determined to find it and restore balance to the Stackspires.

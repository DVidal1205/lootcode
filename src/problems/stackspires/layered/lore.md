*A realization, after watching tireless hours of making honorable Spires*

*Problem: Layered*

The Spires of the Stackspires seem to be a lot more than a means to an end for these people. They are critical to their way of life... Rumor has it that the process of layering has magical reinforcement properties, and if that's the case, I could only imagine how strong the base of the spires really is. But if that were true, then why all of the instability? Clearly something is budging somewhere along the stack.

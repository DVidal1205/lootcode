# Solo

We've got a group project coming up, and we plan on sending a handful of our students to the Illustrious Crown Performance Challenge (ICPC), and we need some help organizing our teams. We are allowed to send either 2 or 3 students as a team, but some of our most eager performers have been trying to sneak in. Help us catch the Solo competitors!

## Input

Input will consist of _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)_, which represents the number of team IDs. The next line will consist of _n_ numbers separated by spaces, each representing a team number. Each reference of a team number represents a participant of that team.

```
10
1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 6
```

## Output

Print the teams with a solo competitor, separated by spaces, in ascending order.

```
5 6
```

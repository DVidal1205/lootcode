# Committee

*A committee established to take over reallocation efforts in Vectara*

*Problem: Combinations*

Man that was a lot of work... The VRC (Vectarian Reallocation Committee) is a mess. It's clear they're rusty, like they haven't had to manually do these sort of things in ages? Not to mention all of them are old as dirt. But them being old means they're valuable sources of information, which has led to you hearing something about *The Index Orb.* You're eager to learn more.

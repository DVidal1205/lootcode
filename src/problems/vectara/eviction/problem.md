# Eviction

All Vectarians are assigned strict home addresses by the authorities, in keeping with their dedication to order.
If a neighborhood ever needs to expand or contract, the address listed on the house is automatically updated.

However, this system has been malfunctioning in the recent turmoil, and *homeowners* are breaking into houses left and right, not knowing where to go anymore now that their indexes are lost. Evict them.

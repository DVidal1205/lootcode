# Flooring

Looking at our kitchen floor, we knew we must've done something wrong.

We were trying to reallocate our kitchen floor and were almost done, but we couldn't seem to find a tile that would fit in the final spot.
We have some more tiles and we know **two** of them could combine to make the tile we want.
However, we're having trouble finding which ones.

Normally the kitchen would reallocate itself, but not ever since...

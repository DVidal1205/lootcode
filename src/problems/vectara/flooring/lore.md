# Construction

*Gathered from discussions with homeowners of Vectara*

*Problem: Flooring*

Reallocation? The people here claim that their houses build themselves? Its a bit clearer know that Vectara is a much different place than you expected it to be. It seems dormant now, but there are discussions about how the city would build itself... These neatly organized houses do seem artificially constructed. That would make a lot more sense. But then that begs the question - why has Vectara stopped constructing itself?

# Reallocation

We've had some issues with keeping Vectara's size as large as it is lately. With less and less people working in various transportation industries, we've had to consolidate some of our city blocks. In an attempt to make the region more tightly knit and space efficient, we seek to reallocate some of our residential buildings closer to the city center.

The issue is, we really want to grab the addresses of the residiencies with the most people in them. However, due to the nature of our contiguous construction conventions, we can only grab adjacent households to relocate. We could use some help determining which segment of a given city block to relocate, given a specific size of the segment we can relocate.

## Input

Input will consist of _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6)_, representing the number of households to read in, and _m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)_, representing the size of the segment to reallocate. The next line will consist of _n_ numbers, separated by spaces, representing the number of people in each household.

## Output

Print the starting index of the segment of households with the maximum number of people in them. If there are multiple segments with the same number of people, print the starting index of the segment with the smaller starting index. Then, on the following line, print the number of people in the segment.

*At long last, you've gotten to the bottom of the Index Orb*

*Problem: Reallocation*

The VRC has done it again, despite opposition from most of the people. Everyone is displaced, and you've finally figured it out - *The Index Orb.* This orb is the core of Vectara and what has made this city what it is - yet somehow, it seems to have just vanished into thin air. You plan to help these people survive for as long as it takes for you to find and reclaim the Index Orb for them.

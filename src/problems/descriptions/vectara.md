# Vectara
The contiguous realm of Vectara is a sight to behold. Spanning across the oblong rectangular mountain range rests the Vectarans, who pride themselves on their organized structure of civilization. 

The Vectarans are incredibly refined people, wearing intricate garbs used to identify status, employment positions, or social status. In the long contiguous residential or commercial blocks, every establishment is addressed in a way that creates a linearly formatted society. Order is everything to the Vectarans.

However, things seemed to have been slipping as of late. The powerful order of the nation has begun to slip, and at a cost. Governmental bodies are beginning to dissolve in the absence of sound decision making, and residencies are being foreclosed due to nationwide financial struggles. Something is happening here, and no one seems brave enough to admit it - let alone claim why.

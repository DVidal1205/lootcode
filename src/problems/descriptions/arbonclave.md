# Arbonclave
The Arbonclave is a society hidden within the depths of an entangling forest. At its center stands an immensely tall tree, said to be the root of all treefolk living within the Arbonclave, and is the tallest peak in Algorion. This tree is deemed the Ursol Tree, and is a critical source of life and prosperity.

The treefolk are unlike anything you've ever seen - extensive bark like skin and incredible wisdom. The treefolk place pride on heritage and ancestry, and reproduce in a fashion similar to mitosis. By placing their left and right hands in the soil of the Arbonclave, they rest dormant for a week and produce two children from the budding soil. These family units remain quite large, with treefolk living up to 250 years, and numerous generations birthed in a lifetime. Family is everything to the treefolk.

However, lately, the organizational structure of the Arbonclave has become a bit off. More importantly, there have been *rumors* of treefolk producing multiple children at a time, generating scares throughout the region.

# Explore the Arborenclave
The Arborenclave is a verdant paradise where the tree-like Arbor species thrive in elaborate treehouses linked by vine bridges, living in close harmony with nature and each other. Rooted deeply in family and ancestry, the Arbors' culture revolves around a simple yet profound cycle of life, where the planting of seeds and the nurturing of offspring form the core of their existence, creating a community tightly woven into the fabric of the forest itself. However, this idyllic existence has been marred by a mysterious blight, causing the once-lush haven to wither and its inhabitants to falter. The vibrant vitality that once flowed through the Arborenclave, sustaining its people and their connections to each other and their environment, has diminished, leaving a shadow of uncertainty over the future. In the face of this creeping decay, there lies a desperate need for intervention to rekindle the lost vitality and reforge the bonds that unite the Arbor races, ensuring the survival of their ancient way of life amidst the encroaching desolation.

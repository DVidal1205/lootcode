# The Tower

Traveling all throughout Algorion, helping its people, and feeling their struggles has been taxing. The grand continent is vast, but you've always wondered about that island across the sea. There's no way this... inconspicuous island with a massive corporate looking tower on it is involved with the turmoil in the planet, right? I guess rowing over there to test couldn't hurt

Upon arriving, you notice something intriguing. Washing up on the shore, you see the immensely large, corporate looking tower, contrast to the magical high fantasy of the rest of the planet. Up above you, a _human_ stands on a balcony, looking over the island. This is the only other human you've seen on this planet, it hadn't really hit you until now. You lock eyes with them, and they become visibly taunting. They gesture you into the base of the tower as the doors open.

**"HOW HEROIC? HOW NOBLE? YOU THINK YOU'RE SMART FOR FINDING THIS PLACE, BUT I'LL SHOW YOU JUST HOW WRONG YOU ARE!"** the human boasts as you enter the tower. As you take a look before entering, you notice that the tower has 13 floors, and through the glossy corporate glass, you see the long lost magic items of Algorion scattered across each floor. This human was the one who stole them all, perhaps to harness their power? Or maybe, it was just for the thrill of it. Either way, you're going to have to get them back.

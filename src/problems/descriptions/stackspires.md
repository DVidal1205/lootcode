# Stackspires
More than most regions, the Stackspires is one of magic that really makes you question reality. The region is a large stone plateau, built upon layers and layers of stones, but what is odd, is that the first stone is actually quite small, perhaps even the size of a pebble. In a reverse-cone fashion, the Stackspires grow up and outwards for a few thousand feet, before being wide enough to sustain the Stackcities, all balancing on a small pebble. It is said that a base of any kind - whether it be architecture, knowledge, or reason - is made as strong as the amount of things atop it.

Beyond the complex geography and beautifully tall spires, the people of the Stackspires function much differently than you. They seem to lack the sense of foresight, often acting very spontaneously and with low emotional intelligence. However, by focusing on the present, the people of the spires are incredibly innovative and creative, constantly focused on continual improvement of themselves, their peers, and the spires.

Lately, though, the stability of the Stackspires has been under question. The largest threat faced by the spires is the sudden re-balancing, a term the locals use to describe the catastrophic tremors and earthquakes that have occurred for months now. The people fear for their region, and they theorize something fundamentally terrible has happened to the spires. It is only a matter of time before it gets worse.
